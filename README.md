# FreudCS

Hi, Freud Client-Side ( [FreudCS|https://github.com/freudgroup/freudcs] ), covers a series of experiments in scaffolding for client side projects.
The idea is to re-create wheels as wheels are made in other client side communities.
Covering from minimal project setup to more flambuoyant head start examples in client side development.

All these refer to existing node projects and client side libraries.
Help yourself wit one if you need to.
They are under ```/Boilerplates``` folder.

Feel free to increment the boilerplates.
Add new things like Gulp instedad of Grunt, Typescript maybe, go insane.. 

The repository is named after half diligent half erratic cat, that has nothing to do with psychoanalisis.
Gracias.
